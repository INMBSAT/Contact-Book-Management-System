# Contact-Book-Management-System
This C++ program implements a contact book management system using a binary search tree for efficient searching and sorting of contacts. It allows users to add, search, update, and delete contacts with a console-based UI. The system validates contact numbers and uses standard libraries such as iostream, fstream, and string.h.
